### My notes

[Notion notes](https://nicolasarevalo.notion.site/Technical-interview-IndiGo-4907174803914799878bbf167e55a79b) where I track my progress and explain what I'm doing.

### Explanation

This project is how I'm solving the technical interview. The problem was consuming an API (music, pokemon, movies...) I chose _movies_. 
Then I did the mockup. First I did a wireframe handmade. Then I did it on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/sf4ubNZJqskHrNdgL6QaiF/IndiGO-movies)

### Technologies:

* Html, Css, Js, -> React
* Preprossesor -> Sass
